 ~ 2. Overview ~
  MessagePop is a simple program for displaying a message, which you set via 
  command line arguments, in a window which stays on top of any other windows.
  You can set the body text, title text and OK/close-button text.

 ~ 3. Installation ~
  MessagePop is too simple to have an installer. Just copy the .exe to wherever
  you want to use it from. I suggest you create a new folder at 
  C:\Program Files\Nitemice Software, and put in there. 

 ~ 4. Usage ~
  So the basics of how to use MessagePop are:
   • You run the program however you want, with the message as a command line parameter. 
   • You can also set the title text and the button text by simply putting a hash "#" 
     with a space on both side, and then the next bit of text. So to specify all three,
	 it should look something like this: 

  This is my message. # Titles are cool! # Press the button! 

   • You can skip entering a message or title text if you want by hashing past it, 
     e.g. if you don't want to specify a title, but you do want to specify the button 
	 text, write your message, and then adding "space hash space hash space" ( # # )
	 and then type what you want the button to say. 

   • You can quickly close MessagePop by hitting either the Enter or Escape keys.

  MessagePop can be used in various ways. It can be run on a schedule like an alarm, 
  from command line as a warning or alert prompt, or from a shortcut for some reason.
  If you've got an idea for how to use MessagePop, go ahead! 
  And tell me, because I'd love to know!
